### Solved some questions on GFG

* Maximum Index -> The task is to find the maximum of j - i subjected to the constraint of A[i] < A[j] and i < j.
* Max sum in the configuration -> Given an array(0-based indexing), you have to find the max sum of i*A[i] where A[i] is the element at index i in the array. The only operation allowed is to rotate(clock-wise or counter clock-wise) the array any number of times.
